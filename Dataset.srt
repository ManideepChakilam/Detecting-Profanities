1
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,277
That bastard! 
Claire wanted to scream.

2
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,644
Marty honey, dinner.

3
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,514
I'm sick 
of this crap.

4
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,917
<i>His legs?</i>

5
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,487
<i>That seemed to piss her off.</i>

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,466
And he ate me out
for an hour.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,399
Lisa, you know,

8
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,235
it's all about attitude.
If you want it, you can get it.

9
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,639
You just got to get
your fuckin' ass on the beach.

10
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,201
- Work for it.
- Whatever.

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,624
Excuse me,
sandwich boy?

12
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,497
Aren't you supposed
to wear gloves,

13
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:32,003
'cause I don't know
where those hands have been.

14
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,475
Fuckin' pigs, man!

15
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:45,284
- My name's Marty, what's yours?
- Just give me the sub, asshole.

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,412
Ask the bitches to meet us,
fuckhole! We'll party.

17
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:52,185
We're going surfing, at 3:00.

18
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,386
If you want to meet us
at North Beach.

19
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,688
Maybe we'll think about it.

20
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,132
Great, babe,
you can be my date.

21
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,533
My friend here
will take that one.

22
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,036
Hey, fuck you, man.

23
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,714
- Those guys were fine.
- He was making fun of me.

24
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:26,020
No shit. He was just being
an asshole. Guys are like that.

25
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,027
But the other one,
the shorter one--

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,824
- The cute one.
- Yeah, Marty.

27
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,864
He acted like
he wanted to meet you.

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,129
- Meet you, you mean.
- No, his buddy's got dibs on me.

29
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,828
His buddy's the boss.

30
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,529
I've never been
around such a hunk.

31
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,537
Oh!

32
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,678
- Cute butt.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,814
He's sweet.
The other one's an asshole.

34
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,172
You wanna go to a party?

35
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,432
Sure.

36
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,116
- You're a pretty hot surfer.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,709
You could go pro.

38
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,582
What planet
are you living on?

39
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,817
Earth, fucker!

40
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,918
Compared to you,
he's fuckin' Kobe Bryant.

41
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,672
- What do you guys want?
- Go get a bottle of tequila.

42
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:56,341
Can you give me some money?
I only got six bucks.

43
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:57,439
What was that, boy?

44
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,452
Was it "Yes sir, boss. I'll buy
that booze for you now?"

45
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,212
What I thought, bitch!

46
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,724
You're an asshole.

47
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,299
Baby,
you know what I like.

48
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,798
Come on up here. 
I'm starting to dig you a little bit.

49
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,643
Damn, baby.

50
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,761
- Welcome to the party, bitch!
- Fuck!

51
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:54,901
Take your pants off.

52
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,306
Come on, baby.

53
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,241
You're fuckin' beautiful.

54
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,321
Back up.

55
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:15,686
Yeah.

56
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,360
Good morning.

57
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:35,204
- I got a new boyfriend, Ma.
- A new what?

58
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,444
- A new boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

59
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,707
What kind?

60
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,814
A hunk.

61
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:45,883
Really?

62
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,544
Yeah,
you're gonna meet him.

63
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,609
I hear your cute friend
gives good phone.

64
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:17,775
Marty's the best.
He'll make you come in two minutes.

65
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,753
- Can I call him?
- No, he'll call you.

66
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,361
He lives with
his parents, you know.

67
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:36,965
Okay look,
right now...

68
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:40,131
$100 if he gets
on stage and dances.

69
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,334
I hope you know
you're getting up there.

70
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,901
<i>No way, man.
No way.</i>

71
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,504
Come on. A hundred bucks
is a hundred bucks.

72
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,480
I can make the money
somewhere else.

73
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,917
Get the fuck up there
right now, it's $100.

74
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:55,181
Go!

75
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,188
Get up there.

76
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,064
Make 'em proud.

77
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:27,245
160, 180, 200...

78
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,372
Plus what you got,
that's 300.

79
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,113
What's the matter, man?

80
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,023
You enjoyed that,
back there, didn't you?

81
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,184
Hell no. I ain't queer
like those guys.

82
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,158
Bullshit.

83
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,593
can you shut the f**k up

84
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:46,427
You're such an a**hole

85
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:47,625
Fuck you!

86
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,723
- Look out!

87
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,063
- Man!

88
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,968
You fuck, you fucked up
my fuckin' car!

89
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,005
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

90
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,908
Watch the fuck out!
You're gonna make me wreck!

91
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,571
- You stupid fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

92
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:03,673
- You piece of shit!
- Motherfucker!

93
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:09,680
- Fuck this goddamn shit!

94
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,250
Marty?

95
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,054
Hey, get in the car.

96
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,126
Fuck you, man.

97
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,342
I'm sorry, man.
Let's just go.

98
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,379
Let's go, I'm sorry.

99
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:39,509
Get your fuckin' hands
off me, Bobby.

100
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,211
I'm really sorry.
